# ReadyAPI Project

ReadyAPI test cases are not included in GitHub CI because they require:
- A licensed installation of ReadyAPI
- A local or enterprise CI runner

To run:
1. Open `ReadyAPI`
2. Import the `.xml` test project (not included here)
3. Run tests manually or through CLI with `testrunner.sh`
